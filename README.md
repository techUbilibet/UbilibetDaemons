# UbilibetDaemons
Daemons for Ubilibet work

Greetings

This repository is created to demonstrate our software is Open Source

This Appilcation is JavaSE, it is not intende to install in any kind of Appserver (like Wildfly), you can see some bash scripts to execute the different modules.

To extract the project open a terminal and execute

$ tar -xzvf Ubilibet-[YYYYMMDD].tar.gz [TARGET]


on YYYYMMDD corresponds to the date of last Update
on TARGET is the directory where you want to extract project.

We use Postgresql Database.

We haven't attached the libraries we use, you will need:

OpenJdk 1.8
JavaMail 1.4.5
JsonSimple 1.1
Log4J 1.2.7
BouncyCastle JDK 1.5
MITyC 1.1.7
Hibernate 4.1
IText 5.5.2

The objective isn't you could execute the software (there is no information about Database content nor SSL certifcates and passwords that are mandatory to work with it

Feel free to copy all code, modify, or joke about it.
